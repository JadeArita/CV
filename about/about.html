  <p class="about-text">
    I’m a Web Development student at <strong>Holy Angel University</strong>, passionate about crafting
    <span class="highlight">clean</span>, <span class="highlight">responsive</span>, and <span class="highlight">interactive</span> web experiences.
    I love turning creative ideas into functional digital solutions and exploring modern frontend technologies like
    <span class="tech">HTML</span>, <span class="tech">CSS</span>, <span class="tech">JavaScript</span>, and <span class="tech">React</span>.
    Curious and detail-oriented, I enjoy experimenting with <span class="highlight">UI/UX design</span> and new frameworks,
    continuously improving my skills through projects and hands-on practice. My goal is to create websites and apps
    that are visually appealing, intuitive, and fun to use.
